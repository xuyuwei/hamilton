Must have concorde added to path

Graph.py:
- Graph class that stores adjacency representation, s2v representation, and can run concorde on of graphs instances

DataSet:
- Creates a set of graphs drawn froma  similar distribution in s2v format
- Makes directory and moves to the data folder under graph_classification

Generate.py:
 - Used for specifying parameters for a specific dataset
 
NOTE: 
Folders for ../graph_classifiation/data are generated by o-x_y/ where x is the fraction of edges that are included in the graph and y is the number of sample points.  If previous examples with the same ratio and number of samples are in ../graph_classification/data then they may be overwritten.
